# Pathfinding using A* Algorithm

A mini-game visualization of A* Algorithm in Python 3 using PyGame.
Requirement: Pygame, pygame-menu

#### Free Run

- Clicking Left Mouse Button for the first time creates the starting grid.
- Clicking Left Mouse Button for the second time creates the destination grid.
- Clicking Left Mouse Button for the third time creates barrier grid.
- Right Mouse Button removes cells created.
- Escape button resets all grid.
- Press SPACEBAR after creating all the cells to draw the path

Note:
- Requires PyGame module.
- Paths can be straight line as well as diagonal. 
- Contains global variables which, I understand, are very bad and nasty. :/ 
- This program is not written with coding standards. Beginner level.
- Might have some bugs. Haven't done any QA. Let me know if you find any.
